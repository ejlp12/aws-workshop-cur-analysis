## Event Engine Access

The AWS Event Engine was created to help AWS field teams run Workshops, GameDays, Bootcamps, Immersion Days, and other events that require hands-on access to AWS accounts.

Open a browser and navigate to the event engine login page: https://dashboard.eventengine.run. You will be presented with terms and login page. Please read and understand the terms governing use of event engine accounts.

Set your team name if you like. We have enough accounts for participants to each have their own account, but all participants are welcome to form teams.

Here there are instructions for CLI credentials, but this will not be needed as todays workshop uses the Cloud9 console and IDE as an administrative environment.

Please let the event staff know if you have any difficulty.
